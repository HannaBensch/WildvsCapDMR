# Wild vs Captive gut DMR

In this repository are code and data for analysis and plots in manuscript "*Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes - captivity changes the gut microbiota composition and diversity in a social subterranean 
rodent*" (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1732762/v1). 16S Amplicon data from 109 fecal samples from Damaraland mole-rats used in this analysis, ASV table, taxonomy table and metadata can be found in "data" - folder.


*Please note that all animals origin from the same source population (the captive animals origin from the wild) and "Population" in metadata is equal to "group" in manuscript.*


**Scripts:**

1) **Alphadiv.Rmd** - *Alpha diversity*
2) **Ancom.Rmd** - *difference abundance*
3) **Betadiv.Rmd** - *beta diversity* 
4) **Relab.Rmd** - *Relative abundances & prop. unassigned taxa*
